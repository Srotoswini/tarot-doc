# "THREE OF CUPS" 7 "MAY 2017" "Tarot Documentation" "Tech Autonomy Manuals"

## NAME

Three of Cups - Tarot card with numeric value 3 and suit of Cups.

## SYNOPSIS

Friends gather with a sense of belonging, togetherness, and solidarity.

## DESCRIPTION

The `Three of Cups` is the feeling of togetherness that comes from shared purpose and clearly communicated visions. It is the comfort you feel towards and from those with whom you have placed resources in common. In this emotion are the foundations of trust, solidarity, vulnerability, collective action, and communal strength from which all power beyond oneself flows forth. The `Three of Cups` is often depicted as three jubilant friends sharing a drink, symbolizing the fluid and ever-shifting connection that forms a group existing in harmony with one another.

## IN A READING

## ENVIRONMENT

## NOTES

There are several meanings underscoring why it is important that the `Three of Cups` embodies the numeric value *3*. A group of three individuals, also called a *triad*, is the atomic unit of all larger group dynamics. This is in contrast to a *dyad*, more commonly called a *couple*. Triadic relationships are also arguably the most stable structure on which to build communities (of any size).

### Triadic relationships

A triadic relationship has two parts: the relationship between three individuals, and the three elements of any given dyad's relationship to eachother and the group. For example, if Alex, Blair, and Chris all know one another, their relationship (regardless of rapport or animosity) is a triad. Within this triad, the following dyads (pairs of two) exist:

* Alex and Blair
* Alex and Chris
* Blair and Alex
* Blair and Chris
* Chris and Alex
* Chris and Blair

Each of these dyads are unique relationships, or *dyadic relationships*. Moreover, each dyadic relationship is itself structurally triadic. For example, there are three components to the relationship between Alex and Blair:

* The *individual* relationship (the relationship between Alex and Blair)
* The *group* relationship (the relationship Alex and Blair have as a dyad in relation to the triad)
* The *meta* relationship (the relationship Alex and Blair have, together, about what it means to them to be in a triadic relationship with Chris)

This intra-dyadic triadic structure can be visualized by a triangle, see https://maybemaimed.com/2014/01/14/metamour-intensive-by-rebecca-transcending-boundaries-conference-2012/.
