## DESCRIPTION

`The World` is the all-encompassing whole in which everything resides. Good and evil, greatness and insignifcance, completion and anticipation, all things are contained herein. `The World` is often depicted as a woman holding long scrolls, as in the-world-rider-waite-smith(7), symbolizing the integration of both material and intangible items, energy and matter, together.

## IN A READING

Accomplishment, completeness, and involvement. `The World` appears when you are at or approaching the peak of your energies, or when all of your skills, resources, and resourcefulness is brought to bear. This can be nourishing and relaxing, but may also be taxing and demanding.

If the querent has queried the future, `The World` often represents the culmination of a task or the anticipation of a success.

## ENVIRONMENT

Although representing wholeness, `The World` is greatly affected by its environment. This includes environmental factors within itself (the microcosm) as well the environ in which `The World`, itself, resides (the macrocosm). Some factors are more influential than others.

`Temperance`
  When present, signifies to `The World` that there is balance between its numerous, possibly opposing, forces.

`The Sun`
  Amplifies the energies of `The World`, or imbues it with further strength.
